This project hosts portlets for navigation as well as so called breadcrumbs.

## Navigation bar ##
The navigation bar is made as a portlet to easier accomodate custom behavior compared with a traditional solution where the rendering is made with templates (freemarker) in the theme code. A screenshot is seen below:

The navigation bar shows the first level of pages in the bar and the second level of pages is shown on hovering over a first level page, as seen in the screenshot.

## Breadcrumbs ##
The breadcrumbs portlet shows the hierachy of the pages for each level you have navigated, as seen below:
